# Introduction

This is the official **GY Accounts** service used by GYCODING for internal account management.

We provide a full **[API reference](#)**, containing all the available **endpoints**, **documentation** and a **changelog** with the new features or bugfixes from all the versions of this API.

This API REST uses **Spring Web**. For the deployment, **Docker** is being used along with **Koyeb** for the hosting.
