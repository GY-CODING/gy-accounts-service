# Introduction

This is the official **GY Accounts** service used by GYCODING for internal account management.

We provide a full **[API reference](#)**, containing all the available **endpoints**, **documentation** *(Javadoc)* and a **changelog** with the new features or bugfixes from all the versions of this API.

<br>

# How it was made

This API REST uses **Spring Web** for the whole API REST functionality and **Spring Data** to access to our **MongoDB** database. For the deployment, **Docker** is being used along with **Koyeb** for the hosting.

The reference static website was made using just **HTML**, **CSS** and some **JavaScript**, while the documentation was made automatically using **Dokka** for the Code Docs and **Postman** for the API Docs.
